Assistant:

Here's a `README.md` file for your open-source Bitcoin wealth management script:

**Bitcoin Wealth Management Script**
===============================

This script provides a simple way to generate addresses from a seed or a 24-word mnemonic. It supports various types of addresses, including Legacy (P2PKH), P2SH-SegWit (P2WPKH in P2SH), and Native SegWit (Bech32).

**Getting Started**
-------------------

To get started, you'll need to install the required dependencies:

* `click`
* `mnemonic`
* `bip_utils`

You can do this using pip:
```
pip install click mnemonic bip-utils
```
Once installed, you can run the script using the following commands:

* `generate-new-wallet`: generates a new wallet with 5 addresses (default)
* `generate-wallet-from-mnemonic`: generates a wallet from an existing 24-word mnemonic

**Examples**
------------

### Generate New Wallet
--------------------

```bash
$ generate-new-wallet --num-addresses=10
```
This will generate a new wallet with 10 addresses.

### Generate Wallet from Mnemonic
------------------------------

```bash
$ generate-wallet-from-mnemonic --num-addresses=5 my_mnemonic_24_words
```
Replace `my_mnemonic_24_words` with your 24-word mnemonic. This will generate a wallet with 5 addresses using the provided mnemonic.

**Disclaimer**
-------------

**You are responsible for managing the safety of your mnemonic phrase.**

Make sure to store your mnemonic phrase in a secure location, such as an encrypted file or a password-protected vault. Losing access to your mnemonic phrase can result in permanent loss of your Bitcoin funds.
